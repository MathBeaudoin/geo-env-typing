# Project
The project geographic-typing aims to provide types, classes and data-validations for developpers wanting to use geographic, solar, and air-quality data. The first version of the project is still under development, and is mainly based on the response from Google's APIs.

# Programming languages support
Every supported programming language has a dedicated directory for all types and functions \
\
At the moment, only TypeScript is supported. Other languages might be added in the future.
