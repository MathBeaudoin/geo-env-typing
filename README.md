# Project
The project geo-env-typing aims to provide types, classes and data-validatiors for developpers wanting to use geographic, solar, and air-quality data. The first version of the project is still under development, and is mainly based on the response from Google's APIs.

# Programming languages support
Every supported programming language has access to the same types and functions. The project is structured to give a dedicated directory to each language (e.g. `src/typescript/*`). As of February 2024, only TypeScript typing is supported.

### TypeScript
Support for TypeScript is also offered through an NPM package. Install it using the following command:
```
npm install -D geo-env-typing
```
